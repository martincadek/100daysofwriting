2020-08-14T23:07:59Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 25) Eh. Writing kinda did not happen today ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . I had a lot on my to-do list, most of it related to job preparation, reflection, and then some errands. In such cases, I write a sentence or two to get me started for tomorrow. I also baked a baguettes ü•ñ . https://t.co/t0Z7j0cida",278,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-13T16:07:44Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 24) Wanted to finish early but forgot to start early. Still. I wrote. Met my goal. Got this flow feeling as I had burst of inspiration from reading https://t.co/aw2Jio3nlc. I think ""we"" write well when it gets a little personal but it's fragile equilibrium. https://t.co/78UEaodNro",280,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-12T18:22:11Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 23) Done. Progressed. It was good to set target of words per day (200). It also feels okay to not be overly ambitious but manage it in small chunks. Focusing on detail helps, but hopefully I won't forget the global scene. Glad I don't use ink. It's too hot. https://t.co/tR5sTP3GpR",280,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-11T16:56:24Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 22) Today I did not start as early so I had to write through 35¬∞C in flat. I did manage to complete my goal. I also tried various things to artificially create breeze in flat using fan and ice and, meh. I am a little delirious so off to a park. https://t.co/cH1tyveSDB",267,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-10T21:03:42Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 21) Today I did two things right. Managed to start a little earlier and outran the heat, also managed to write over my goal (slightly over 400 words, reading, discussion). Still. Having 35¬∞C in flat is no fun. Then I went to a park. https://t.co/NSsdufzrcG",255,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-09T15:55:09Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 20) ""Finally"" getting my hands ""dirty"" with writing - 313 words. I don't think it would have been possible without the work on the literature but I will also aim to be more consistent and set up goal of 200 words a day. However, the hot weather is toughü•µ. https://t.co/c5xkgiwy34",278,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-06T22:32:43Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 19) More literature on public health messaging. Discovered new term called ""Synthetic personalisation"". Not writing, just reading. Not sure how to balance it out but I feel like these are sequential steps (read to write). Not happy about the hot weather ü•µ",278,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-05T22:41:10Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 18) Enlightening day spent on literature regarding Public Health Messaging. I also realise how limited is my knowledge of linguistics. I lack the verbal categories, terms, schemas to apply and look for in text. Nonetheless, I persevere.",259,100DaysOfWriting
2020-08-04T22:44:58Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 17) Back to it. Spent the day on reading a chapter about genre analysis of public health campaigns - amazing stuff. Getting used to SQ3R to balance my neurodiversity but sometimes the text just doesn't flow and nothing helps.,248,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-30T20:21:50Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 16) Wrote introduction to the next part of the Discussion. In the part I discuss results of genre analysis of the NCMP letters. One of the challenges is that there's no such past research on the letters done in the literature so I have to really dig deep.,278,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-29T18:03:50Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 15) Took me 15 days to write the first part of Discussion and only a ""part"" of the first study. The process feels so slow. There is also a lot of reading involved. Thinking. Preparing. Still. Today was productive, but I feel isolated in this journey too.",277,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-28T22:29:15Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 14) At last, done reading the literature for part of the study 1. I wrote a little, but the progress is slow. I am not sure if I am doing it right - even after reading multiple other discussions and articles on how to write it.",250,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-27T20:49:15Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 13) Just need to review the last report and then onto discussing the key results of the first study. The importance of reading the reports was to establish how to best discuss the results in already known evidence - but it is lengthy process! 8454 words,276,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-25T16:56:44Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 12) Wrote a little about key reports discussing the NCMP in England. Still have to go through one and half report (each about 70 pp) but it is worth it. That's it for today. Will do more tomorrow.,219,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-24T22:41:26Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 11) This week was challenging. Today I managed to find the time to review an important article (below) for discussion but having to go through three job interviews made it difficult to stop, think, write. ""Luckily"" this isn't likely to happen the next week. https://t.co/lom84udqgE",280,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-22T23:12:32Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 10) Did not write a single word on thesis today as it turns out that job applications and writing are sort of either or position. Preparing presentations for tomorrow. Need to factor in for these things as well.,234,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-21T22:24:41Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 9) Re-reading some of the key literature but today felt sluggish. I have to balance it with writing. Spending too much on reviewing and overthinking things.,179,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-20T23:51:25Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 8). Literature reviewing day. Aimed to built a list of what I need to use for the Discussion - initially tried to allocate literature to each section but that was impractical and it was much better to frame it according to the research questions. https://t.co/43b6PR3ktm,269,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-19T21:37:27Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 7) a week. I started well, then got stuck. I fulfilled my ambition to have the structure of discussion chapter and drafted a timeline. For each section I'll write what literature I want to use - 8132 words but what counts is the idea of how to move forward. https://t.co/Yo1Ueod50n",280,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-18T23:47:58Z,m_cadek,#100DaysOfWriting (Day 6). Okay. Tomorrow will be better. Let's just leave it at that. üòñ Do weekends count too? I guess...,122,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-15T21:51:44Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 3). Can set onto writing as the structure is done. Tomorrow is head-in to discuss the first principal findings. It feels like battling a hydra - I have to keep the literature review, result, and discussion chapters open and move between them (8076 words). https://t.co/igmAcHaalq",278,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-14T16:54:55Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 2/100). Structure of discussion is clearer. I heavily expanded as I filled relevant places with the results but this will need to be tidied until the discussion is succinct, and clear. Some reading materials on integrating results in mixed-method paradigm. https://t.co/nrDuJuIvDR",279,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-13T21:37:46Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting (Day 1/100) I think I achieved what I intended, it's the start of the discussion, I am making the structure, wrote 400 words but I aim for 15 - 30 pages and it is very challenging. I tend to expand a lot. Here are some resources I used to guide me through this. https://t.co/SgZ1xRBtFE",279,100DaysOfWriting
2020-07-13T17:40:05Z,m_cadek,"#100DaysOfWriting - Decided to make my writing progress public and see what happens (I was counting it anyway). So far, I have written, literature review, methods, and results of my #PhD. Now onto the discussion, but I expect there will be plenty of rewriting and editing. ‚úçÔ∏è",275,100DaysOfWriting
